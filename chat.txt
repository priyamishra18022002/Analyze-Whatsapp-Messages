10/06/20, 16:56 - Kabadhi: *Guys start joining the blogscord voice channel on discord*
10/06/20, 17:48 - Siddhant: *Attention everyone* 

I've been recently watching that the discord meetings haven't been going on pretty well, whether it is your non interactive nature or the absence in meetings or some other issues.
So I'm saying this very frankly, if anyone of you thinks that weekly meetings are a waste of time and we shouldn't have it then so be it. We'd just have the month end meetings then.
All of you unanimously take a decision and give me an answer by tonight!

Regards,
Siddhant
Vice President
10/06/20, 18:07 - Vaishnavi Blogger: I personally think that anything important can be discussed over text. The weekly meetings can be done over text, where instead of joining a call, we discuss it here itself. Just a thought.
11/06/20, 01:34 - Siddhant: So, what decision have you all taken regarding the meetings?
11/06/20, 04:04 - Kanushree: Your blogs are posted on our Facebook page. So please do share your blogs on fb.
https://www.facebook.com/pg/SchaffenSoftwares/posts/
11/06/20, 09:01 - Nanditesh BlogsCord: Sir regarding the meetings, I think, it'll be effective in communication when we unmute the mic for all, when joining, we can mute the mic, set up a place quiet to attend the meet and when the meet starts, we can allow everyone to unmute the mic
11/06/20, 09:01 - Nanditesh BlogsCord: I agree to this too
11/06/20, 14:05 - Srashti Milan Schaffen: https://www.blogscord.com/post/artificial-intelligence-servant-or-master

When we think of AI , it appears that it has a promising future. But - Is AI really that promising ?

" Ok. I will destroy humans" , " the world would be a better place if there were no humans " - these are the statements of the AI machines developed by humans.

Just like the movie - Contagion turned out to be true in 2020 , can ' The Terminator ' also turn out to be true in future ?

Protests have always been the voice of our democratic system. With the time, the way people voice their reasons and arguments have changed from peaceful movements to hate filled violence. Is it right?

11/06/20, 15:30 - Kabadhi: *ATTENTION*
So taking many of your problems into consideration we have decided there will only be one meeting in the month end taken by The President. That meeting will not be taken by me and the Co-ordinators so please don't try to miss that.

      There are few points which board have said for your easy workflow -

1. Interact among yourself! The more you will interact the more you will like the working environment.

2. There is specific departments for each and everything in Schaffen Softwares or even in the BlogsCord so if you are facing any problem go to the specific department.

3. Write the blogs on time. All the contents which comes on our web site is top level but some post don't get much attention just because it is posted late at night. So please write your blogs beforehand only don't try to complete the work on deadline.

   At last I just wanna say, Everyone is happy with our work! We are really a good team and one of the best department in Schaffen Softwares. So please I think the mistakes which we had done in previous will not be repeated.

Regards

And the advent of AI-driven DNA analysis will add a further dimension to the problems already encountered. Defence lawyers could rightly challenge the use of this technology, even if its use is limited to intelligence gathering rather than providing prosecution evidence. Unless transparency problems are addressed at an early stage, the obstacles to AI use in the forensic field could prove insurmountable.

How might we go about tackling these challenges?

14/06/20, 23:04 - 🙂: Hey Everyone!
       
        Hope you all are doing good. May be our Editorial Head had told you about target of this month. If not let me clear something to you all. We all have to get 40k+ views this month with 8k+ site traffic.

        In the first week, 14 blogs were written and the blog views were 11k.

        In the second week, 19 blogs were written and blog views were 5.2k.

        Half of the month is passed and we have achieved around 16.2k post views which should be around 20k+ till now. 

So can you please tell us where is the loophole coming. Why are you all not gaining views? Is there any problem in management? Any problem with BlogsCord team?

    See you are the best by product we have launched till now and we expect a lot from you all. So please be focus on your goals. And if there is any problem regarding BlogsCord team or Schaffen Team you can message me on discord.

    Hope these results will be good next week. Although the website has been updated! The top three bloggers for this weeks are -


1. Satakhshi - 2020 views
2. Darshita - 1014 views
3. Nanditesh - 342 views.

*Best of luck for this week*

15/06/20, 19:28 - Kabadhi: Hey everyone,

From yesterday I was observing that you guys would respond back to President's message. But unfortunately it is sad to point out that no one really replied back saying sorry. It's a high time now, the views are degrading day by day! We were planning to get sponsors for your blogs but now the sponsors don't want to sponsor our blogs because they are not satisfied with the view count. We want your efforts to be recognised and valued in monetary terms. If nothing is gonna change, we will soon may have to shut down this website. 

All the board members are really dissatisfied. It's really sad for me. I am being as much lineant as possible but at the end my job is at risk. 

*Acknowledge this message with your suggestion/problems/comments/anything but acknowledgement is must.*

Waiting for your responses, if you guys don't want to get paid for the hard work you put in writing and promoting the blogs, do tell us so that we should also stop bothering about your welfare.

Regards,
Siddhartha Singh

15/06/20, 19:43 - +91 95603 56525: I had this suggestion regarding the publicity of the blogging site. 
If any one is in contact or could contact any insta blogger and convince them to promote our blogging site, the traffic could be increased.
15/06/20, 19:45 - +91 95603 56525: Also
Maybe we could start an insta page of blogscord or maybe this could be done with the schaffen softwares page  too that we could write like insta quotes sort of like 2 or 3 liners related to our blog in a post like the insta pages we have rn. As a caption to that  post we could share our blog link with the caption something  like click the link below for the full insight.
15/06/20, 19:46 - Nanditesh BlogsCord: Sir we're trying our level best to improve the blog content and the reach as well, but despite sharing the blogs a lot, people aren't really viewing the blogs and that's the issue
15/06/20, 19:47 - Nanditesh BlogsCord: But I'll definitely find a way out, just some people to contact 🙏
15/06/20, 19:49 - Vaishnavi Blogger: +1
15/06/20, 20:01 - Ashutosh Blogger: We are sharing our blogs as much as we can but people don't read them. We gave description also along with the link but they are still not viewing the blogs...so this may be one of the issue.
But still we will give our best.
15/06/20, 20:04 - Niyati Blogger: I feel schaffen software ki site pe jb blogs publish horhe the tb sb naya naya tha and everyone was more into it isiliye traffic accha mil raha tha website ko waha pe, no matter as much we share our blogs point ye h ki pehli baare dusri baar teesri baar people support uske baad there are rare jo kholna bhi bother krte hai bolne ke baad bhi and again blogscord is new to traffic waise hi kam hona tha and hmlog jo pehle se likh rhe hai unke bhi 4-5 blogs ho hi gye hai to ab slow ho raha hai thoda. Can't we try some paid promotions? Like those with some less pay amount
15/06/20, 20:04 - Pragi: There are some blogs that  fall into a specific category which has a limited audience... People who find it interesting read it and also they wait for more... Maybe this is also a reason...
15/06/20, 20:05 - Niyati Blogger: Basically i feel one time hai ek baar mil gaya traffic fir hmare contacts me share krne pe add on hi hote jaege and that will be beneficial ek baar sponsors milne lge to compensate bhi ho jaega paisa
15/06/20, 20:05 - +91 95210 23005: I agree to this
15/06/20, 20:16 - Pragi: Also we cannot force people to read the content...For a span of time only we can poke them to read and share it but then we won't be having genuine readers. How will blogscord grow then?
15/06/20, 20:18 - Mahima Pragi: I agree to this🙋🏻‍♀

People share content on instagram a lot. 
Especially the content they find relevant.

Also we could start a weekly series kind of something. 
Focusing on the weeks agenda, i.e, things going around the world. That'll get us more audience because I feel people like to read about things that are relevant to the present. 
For example, this week's news is going to be about Sushant Singh Rajput and discovering bollywood's hidden secrets, etc. 

We could cover these topics and bring out as much meaning as we can from them. 

Also, weekly agendas keep changing. For this week, there is much more focus on Bollywood. For another week, there would be on something political.
15/06/20, 20:26 - +91 75100 48668: This idea is really great but for people who have published their blogs, one needs to go through the link and as we all know Instagram can add only a single link in bio.
15/06/20, 20:27 - +91 75100 48668: And we publish 2+ blogs a single day
15/06/20, 20:28 - +91 94506 32203: That's right
15/06/20, 20:29 - Darshita: I personally think that the kind of audience one has in their followers list or in their friends list on Facebook might like blogs that relate to them. Now their interests need to be identified. The blogs written should be made sure that they are relatable with the audience we have. So that we get more views. Providing readers with the content they would want to read is one of the best ways to get more views or clicks.
15/06/20, 20:30 - +91 75100 48668: That'd be great cuz on Facebook, engagements if taken care, are greatly enhanced
15/06/20, 20:31 - Darshita: For this I'd even suggest that instead of choosing one topic, maybe we can short list and ask our readers the kind of genres they would be interested in via Instagram poll.
15/06/20, 20:32 - Faraaz: I have a suggestion to make. 
Will it be possible that we outsource our bloggers? Like, we can provide bloggers to other startups and other companies to write for them. We can write for bogscord and for the company or person we're outsourced to.
15/06/20, 20:35 - Raj Aryan Blogger: +1
I agree to this👍👍
15/06/20, 20:48 - +91 75100 48668: Just wanted to say that whosoever takes up the responsibility of making the blogscord page on Instagram, do add me too as one of the admins.
I have a little but satisfactory experience of managing a page on Instagram.
15/06/20, 21:58 - Kabadhi added Technical Guru Ji
15/06/20, 22:48 - Technical Guru Ji: I think the topics that people search the most, should be targeted at once.

Instead of thinking, what others would relate to, think, what you'd relate to.
Don't just write blogs for the sake of writing.
Think.
What did you search on Google recently?
Think.
What did you do recently?

How do people relate to memes that are based on a personal experience?
It's because most of the people, face similar conditions on a daily basis.

Think about what you do and what you like.
Write about it!

Don't force yourself to write about trending topics just because of the trend.

*Write about something which you yourself would want to read if someone suggests you.*

*I hope you understand my point here and do reply with your ideas and opinions.*
15/06/20, 22:50 - Nanditesh BlogsCord: This was a really helpful and a good one
15/06/20, 22:50 - Nanditesh BlogsCord: Loved it
15/06/20, 22:50 - Nanditesh BlogsCord: I'll surely think of something
15/06/20, 22:51 - Vaishnavi Blogger: Exactly! There's no point trying to be relatable...I write solely because of my love for writing, not because of the response I expect or get.
15/06/20, 22:52 - +91 95194 14871: 🙋🏻‍♂️
15/06/20, 22:52 - Pragi: True that.
15/06/20, 22:52 - +91 70501 23696: Surely mam.
15/06/20, 22:55 - +91 75100 48668: I agree
15/06/20, 22:57 - +91 94506 32203: I agree. 
But we are likely to read something which is not only something that we want to read but also what is being most talked about.
15/06/20, 22:58 - +91 94506 32203: I also have one doubt. 
Are we writing for the sake of being good writers or has this also got something to do with what we call content creation?

I am a little confused here.
15/06/20, 23:35 - +91 6307 275 636: Agree🙌🏻
15/06/20, 23:36 - Technical Guru Ji: If you ask me, Good writers create good content. 
It is a chain reaction. You can't choose to be one of those. It will either be both or none.
And you can't be a good writer if you don't write something you, yourself, would enjoy.
So please, write for your contentment, something that you'd love to write and surely love to read.
15/06/20, 23:49 - Technical Guru Ji: Also, don't just write out of your schedule. Write for yourself.
I've read the blogs and the content is great but what's the point, if no one reads it?

The writing skills you all have, are really impressive, just a little interest and love for your work is needed.

*About the views:*
If you love something you write, you will proudly show it to everyone you know which not just increases the views, but also your confidence.

If you're not sure about your work, why would anyone else bother to read it?

Just think about it.
15/06/20, 23:53 - +91 70501 23696: Yes exactly.. it shouldn't be just for sake of completing the work assigned .
16/06/20, 09:14 - Astha Schaffen: One more issue. Like I've asked a many people to view my blogs but some of them make excuses like that I've tried a lot but m unable to access it.

It was powerful enough to turn off the pressure inside a nuclear power plant and switch off the oil pipelines. It specifically targeted the PLCs which can stop the controllers.

Enzymes are natural catalysts that operate under mild conditions. This makes them an attractive alternative for industrial chemical catalysis, which may require high temperature and pressure and toxic solvents or metals. However, not all chemical reactions can be catalyzed by natural enzymes. Modifying existing enzymes is one option but University of Groningen Chemistry Professor Gerard Roelfes believes that creating new enzymes could be another valuable option.
